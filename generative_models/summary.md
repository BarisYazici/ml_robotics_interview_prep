Deep generative models (DGMs) are a cornerstone of modern artificial intelligence, addressing fundamental challenges in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. These models learn to understand complex, high-dimensional data by mapping signals (like images or speech) to useful representations for decision making.

At their core, generative models learn probability distributions from data, enabling them to generate new, previously unseen examples that maintain the characteristics of the training data. They represent a powerful set of techniques that allow AI systems to create content rather than just analyze it.

```

Evaluating generative models is challenging with no consensus on the "right" approach. Common metrics include:

### Visual Quality Metrics
- **Inception Score (IS)**: Measures quality and diversity of generated images
- **Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID)**: Compares feature distributions between real and generated images
- **Kernel Inception Distance (KID)**: Similar to FID but uses a kernel to compare similarities with a more principled approach
- **Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD)**: Measures statistical distance between distributions

### Density Estimation
- **Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)**: Allows approximation of the underlying probability density function when only samples are available from a model that can't directly evaluate probability

### Domain-Specific Evaluation
- **Text-to-image**: Image quality, text alignment, bias, reasoning, and toxic content
- **Natural Language**: Perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, human evaluation
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering quality, compression efficiency

### Multi-faceted Assessment
- For models like text-to-image systems, a comprehensive evaluation must consider multiple factors beyond just image quality
- Human evaluation remains crucial for many aspects that are difficult to quantify algorithmically

## üßÆ The Curse of Dimensionality

    E[Deep Learning Solutions] --> F[Hierarchical Representations]

    E --> H[Attention Mechanisms]
```

The curse of dimensionality is a fundamental challenge in generative modeling:

- As dimensionality increases, the space becomes exponentially sparser
- Points become equidistant in high dimensions
- Probability distributions become harder to represent and model
- Deep learning helps overcome these challenges through learned representations

## üéì Interview Preparation

### General Concepts

<details>
<summary><b>What are diffusion models and why are they important?</b></summary>
<p>
Diffusion models are generative models that progressively transform data into noise and learn to reverse this process. Their importance stems from their ability to generate high-quality samples across various domains including images, audio, and text, making them fundamental to recent advances in generative AI.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Explain the basic principles of diffusion models</b></summary>
<p>
Diffusion models operate on a two-step process:

1. **Forward Diffusion**: Gradually adding noise to data, corrupting its structure
2. **Reverse Diffusion**: Learning to reverse the noise to reconstruct the original structure

This approach can be likened to a variational autoencoder where the encoder (forward diffusion) adds noise, and the decoder (reverse diffusion) removes it.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What are the key differences between diffusion models and other generative models?</b></summary>
<p>

- Unlike GANs, diffusion models don't require adversarial training, leading to more stable optimization
- Unlike VAEs, diffusion models can generate higher-quality samples at the cost of slower sampling
- Unlike autoregressive models, diffusion models can generate data in parallel rather than sequentially
- Compared to normalizing flows, diffusion models have greater flexibility but less efficient likelihood computation

</p>
</details>

### Technical Details

<details>
<summary><b>What is a score function and how is it used in diffusion models?</b></summary>
<p>
A score function is the gradient of the log probability density (‚àá<sub>x</sub> log p(x)). In diffusion models, score functions guide the denoising process by indicating the direction of increasing probability density. The neural network is trained to estimate these score functions at different noise levels, enabling the gradual reversal of the diffusion process during sampling.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Explain noise schedules in diffusion models</b></summary>
<p>
A noise schedule determines how noise is added during the forward diffusion process. It typically involves increasing variance of Gaussian noise over time. The optimal noise schedule balances:

- Complete destruction of data structure at the final step
- Gradual enough progression to allow learning the reverse process
- Computational efficiency during training and sampling

Various strategies can be employed to find an ideal noise schedule, including learning it as part of the model.
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What is Langevin dynamics and how does it relate to diffusion models?</b></summary>
<p>
Langevin dynamics is a sampling method that uses noisy gradient ascent steps to move toward regions of higher probability. In diffusion models, Langevin dynamics provides the theoretical foundation for the reverse diffusion process, where the estimated score function guides the denoising steps. The stochastic nature of Langevin dynamics helps exploration of the probability space and prevents the model from getting stuck in local maxima.
</p>
</details>

### Advanced Topics

<details>
<summary><b>How can diffusion models be made more efficient?</b></summary>
<p>

Several approaches can improve diffusion model efficiency:

1. **Progressive Distillation**: Training smaller models to match larger ones with fewer steps
2. **Consistency Models**: Aiming for direct one-step generation
3. **Improved Samplers**: Using advanced numerical schemes for SDE solutions
4. **Learned Noise Schedules**: Optimizing the noise addition/removal process
5. **Knowledge Distillation**: Transferring knowledge from larger to smaller models

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How are diffusion models controlled for specific generation tasks?</b></summary>
<p>

Diffusion models can be controlled through several methods:

1. **Classifier Guidance**: Using gradients from a classifier to steer generation
2. **Classifier-Free Guidance**: Training conditional models to respond to guidance strength parameters
3. **Textual Conditioning**: Using text embeddings to guide generation (text-to-image)
4. **Cross-Attention Mechanisms**: Allowing text features to influence the denoising process
5. **ControlNet**: Adding specialized control inputs for specific attributes

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How are diffusion models applied to inverse problems?</b></summary>
<p>
Inverse problems involve recovering full information from partial observations. Diffusion models address these by:

1. Conditioning the reverse process on available measurements
2. Adding measurement consistency terms during sampling
3. Using modified score functions that respect measurement constraints
4. Leveraging pre-trained diffusion models as priors for ill-posed problems

Examples include super-resolution, inpainting, and medical image reconstruction.
