Here's an interview preparation cheat sheet focused on sensor fusion aspects within the context of SLAM, based on the provided source material:
What is SLAM?
•
SLAM stands for Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping. It involves a robot or moving rigid body using sensors to estimate its motion and build a model of the surrounding environment without prior information.
•
Visual SLAM uses a camera as the primary sensor.
Core concepts
•
Non-intrusive sensors: Self-contained sensors like cameras, laser scanners, and IMUs that don't rely on a prepared environment.
•
Intrusive sensors: Sensors that depend on a prepared environment, such as guiding rails or QR codes.
Visual SLAM Framework
•
Sensor data acquisition:  In visual SLAM, this involves acquiring and preprocessing camera images and synchronising with other sensors like motor encoders and IMUs.
•
Visual Odometry (VO): Estimates camera movement between adjacent frames (ego-motion) and generates a rough local map.  It is also known as the frontend.
•
Backend filtering/optimisation: Receives camera poses from VO and loop closing results, then applies optimisation to generate a fully optimised trajectory and map.  It is also known as the backend.
•
Loop closing: Detects previously visited locations to correct accumulated errors in the trajectory and map.
•
Mapping:  Creates a representation of the environment, which can be metrical or topological.
Key Questions and Answers for Sensor Fusion in SLAM
•
Q: Why is sensor fusion important in SLAM?
◦
A: Sensor fusion combines data from multiple sensors to overcome the limitations of individual sensors and create a more robust and accurate SLAM system. For example, visual SLAM can be enhanced by integrating IMU data to handle fast motions, illumination changes, and feature-poor environments.
•
Q: What types of sensors are commonly fused in SLAM?
◦
A: Common sensor combinations include:
▪
Visual-Inertial (Vision + IMU): IMUs provide high-frequency motion data, complementing the visual information from cameras.
▪
Stereo cameras: Provide depth information, improving the accuracy and robustness of visual SLAM.
▪
RGB-D cameras: Offer both colour and depth information, simplifying map building.
•
Q: How does an IMU aid visual SLAM?
◦
A: IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) measure acceleration and angular velocity. This data can be fused with visual information to:
▪
Improve motion estimation, especially during fast movements or when visual features are scarce.
▪
Reduce the scale drift inherent in monocular visual SLAM.
▪
Provide robustness to illumination changes.
•
Q: What are the challenges in fusing data from different sensors?
◦
A: Challenges include:
▪
Sensor synchronisation: Ensuring that data from different sensors is aligned in time.
▪
Different data rates: Handling data arriving at different frequencies.
▪
Noise and uncertainty:  Accounting for the noise characteristics of each sensor.
▪
Calibration: Determining the relative poses and intrinsic parameters of each sensor.
•
Q: What is the role of backend optimisation in sensor fusion?
◦
A: Backend optimisation processes noisy sensor data to estimate the state of the system (robot trajectory and environment map) and calculate its uncertainty. It uses techniques like filtering or nonlinear optimisation to refine the estimated trajectory and map.
•
Q: How can loop closure detection benefit from sensor fusion?
◦
A: Loop closure detection identifies previously visited locations. Fusing data from multiple sensors can improve the accuracy and reliability of loop closure detection, leading to more consistent maps. For example, geometric information from lidar or IMUs can be used to verify loop closures detected visually.
Sensor Fusion Techniques
•
Filters: (e.g., Kalman Filter, EKF) Used for state estimation, combining sensor measurements with a motion model to predict the system's state over time.
•
Nonlinear Optimisation: (e.g., Bundle Adjustment) Refines the estimated trajectory and map by minimising the reprojection error between observed and predicted feature locations.
•
Bundle Adjustment (BA): A non-linear least squares problem that refines both the 3D structure and viewing parameters.
Open Source SLAM Implementations
•
ORB-SLAM: Supports monocular, binocular, and RGB-D cameras. It uses ORB features for visual odometry and loop detection. Has a three-threaded structure.
•
LSD-SLAM: A direct method that performs semi-dense tracking on monocular images.
•
SVO: A semi-direct method that combines feature points and direct methods for camera motion estimation.
Future Trends in Sensor Fusion for SLAM

To continue expanding on sensor fusion in SLAM, here's a deeper dive with more questions and answers in a cheat sheet format, drawing on information from the sources:
Visual Odometry (VO) and Sensor Fusion
•
Q: How does visual odometry benefit from sensor fusion?
◦
A: VO can be made more robust and accurate by fusing data from other sensors. The feature method in VO, which relies on extracting and matching feature points in consecutive images, benefits from sensor fusion in the following ways:
▪
Stability: Feature-based VO is known for its stability, but can be enhanced through sensor fusion to handle challenging scenarios.
▪
Insensitivity to lighting and dynamic objects: While generally insensitive, sensor fusion further improves robustness in these conditions.
◦
Direct methods in VO, which estimate camera pose directly from image pixels, can also benefit from sensor fusion.
•
Q: What is the role of optical flow in visual odometry and how can it be integrated with other sensors?
◦
A: Optical flow describes the movement of pixels between images. Fusing optical flow with other sensors involves:
▪
Tracking key points: Using optical flow to track the motion of key points, which can be combined with data from IMUs or depth sensors to improve motion estimation.
▪
Estimating camera motion: Using the direct method to estimate camera motion based on pixel grayscale values, potentially fusing this information with IMU data for added robustness.
Backend Optimization and Sensor Fusion
•
Q: How is backend optimisation formulated as a state estimation problem in the context of sensor fusion?
◦
A: Backend optimisation aims to estimate the optimal trajectory and map over a longer time by incorporating data from various sensors. This involves:
▪
State estimation: Estimating the state of the system (e.g., robot pose and map) over time, using both motion and observation equations.
▪
Probabilistic perspective: Representing the state as a probability distribution, typically Gaussian, with a mean (optimal estimate) and covariance matrix (uncertainty).
•
Q: What are the main approaches to state estimation, and how do they relate to sensor fusion?
◦
A: Two main approaches exist:
▪
Filtering (Incremental Method): This involves maintaining an estimated state at the current moment and updating it with new data. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a common example. This approach relies on the Markov property, where the current state depends only on the previous state.
▪
Batch Estimation: This involves recording all data and finding the best trajectory and map over all time. This is typically solved using nonlinear optimisation techniques.
•
Q: How do loop closure and pose graph optimisation contribute to improving SLAM accuracy with sensor fusion?
◦
A: Loop closure detects when the robot returns to a previously visited location, providing constraints to correct accumulated drift.
◦
Pose graph optimisation then adjusts the entire trajectory and map based on these loop closures and other sensor data, ensuring global consistency.
Mapping and Sensor Fusion
•
Q: What types of maps can be created in SLAM, and how does sensor fusion enhance map quality?
◦
A: SLAM systems can create various types of maps:
▪
Sparse feature point maps: These maps consist of a set of feature points extracted from sensor data.
▪
Dense maps: These maps provide a more detailed representation of the environment, useful for navigation, obstacle avoidance and interaction.
▪
Semantic maps: These maps incorporate semantic information, such as object labels, to provide a higher-level understanding of the environment.
•
Q: How can dense reconstruction benefit from fusing data from multiple sensors?
◦
A: Dense reconstruction aims to create a detailed 3D model of the environment. Sensor fusion can improve the accuracy and completeness of dense reconstructions by:
▪
Improving depth estimation: Fusing data from stereo cameras or RGB-D sensors to obtain more accurate depth information.
▪
Handling dynamic objects: Implementing methods to remove or track moving objects in the scene, creating more robust maps.
▪
Using OctoMaps: Employing OctoMaps, which are flexible, compressed, and updateable map formats that efficiently store and represent spatial information.
