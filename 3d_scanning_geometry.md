•
Representations of 3D Data:
◦
Point Clouds: Linear array of 3D coordinates (x, y, z) with optional attributes like colour and normals. They sample the surface and are linear in storage complexity [2].
◦
Voxel Grids: Cubic storage, storing values everywhere in 3D space, not just on surfaces [2].
◦
Polygonal Meshes: Piecewise linear surfaces composed of vertices and faces [3]. They can represent the same geometry with different topologies, which can be an issue in reconstruction [7].
◦
Parametric Surfaces: Higher-order surfaces used in CAD modelling and the movie industry, offering non-linear representation with continuous normals, often using cubic degrees for animation [3, 4].
◦
Implicit Surfaces: Defined by a function that represents distance to the surface [4]. Storing a floating-point value per voxel indicating the proximity to the surface [4].

Briefing Document: 3D Scanning & Motion Capture and Pose Estimation

Overview

This document consolidates information from a series of lectures and a research paper focusing on 3D scanning, motion capture, surface representation, reconstruction techniques, optimization methods, and pose estimation using deep learning. The primary focus is on the technical aspects of creating 3D representations from various data sources and techniques for refining and optimising these representations, before branching into modern developments in pose estimation.

Key Themes and Ideas

1. 3D Scanning Fundamentals & Surface Representation

Depth Images: The process of 3D scanning often involves capturing depth images, where each pixel stores the distance from the camera to the corresponding point on the object. "Now instead of just getting the image in a depth image you will also store the respective distance per pixel to the camera right so this is a depth image." The representation is typically along the z-axis, not the raw ray length, but this is important to distinguish. Intrinsic matrices are used to project from camera space to screen space, while extrinsics define the camera's pose in the world.
Implicit vs. Explicit Surface Representations:
Explicit: Triangle meshes, defined by vertices and faces. These are versatile and can represent arbitrary topologies. The standard file formats are “off files obj files St STL files and ply files". Issues include potentially representing invalid surfaces.
Implicit: Represented by a scalar function where the surface is a level set (isosurface). "Implicit form right we just say we have f x y and z and at every position we map to some value but this value is not the surface right um so the surface is defined rather um as a level set of this TR variate Scala function". Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) are a common type of implicit surface, where the function's value indicates the distance to the surface, and the sign indicates inside or outside. SDFs are often stored on a per-voxel basis.
Signed Distance Fields (SDFs): A "distance field tells you how far away from the surface you are." This is a crucial concept for several reconstruction and rendering techniques. The sign indicates whether you are in front of or behind the surface and the sign tells you "inside or outside the surface it could even also mean that it's known versus unknown."
2. Reconstruction Techniques

Marching Cubes: A method for extracting a triangle mesh from an implicit surface (like an SDF). It examines cells in a 3D grid and determines how the surface intersects each cell based on the sign changes of the SDF values at the cell corners.
Radial Basis Functions (RBFs): A method for creating implicit surfaces from point clouds. The surface is approximated by a sum of scaled and translated kernel functions. "Each complex function can be approximated by a sum of simple scale and translated kernel functions." Normal constraints, where sample points are shifted along the normal direction are added to solve the problem.
Hoppe Method: A simpler reconstruction method that locally approximates the surface as a plane based on the nearest neighbor in the point cloud. "You just find the closest point um you get this point P you compute the dot product between the normal if you're on the on the surface that means this would be zero if you're in outside the surface it would mean that you're greater than zero if you're inside it would mean that you're smaller than zero."
Surface Integration: The sign changes meaning depends on which technique is being used. It is important not to make assumptions. “Inside outside the surface" but this is "not true here anymore now the sign has a slightly different meaning in this case the sign means in front of the surface if it's positive and if it's negative then it means it's behind the surface."
3. Optimization

Least Squares: A core optimization technique used extensively. The goal is to minimize the sum of squared residual terms. Both linear and non-linear least squares problems are discussed. "Our goal of this least squares is that we want to find the optimal x such that this function f of x is minimized right so we want to find the optimal version of x this is our goal what we want to do."
Solvers:
Linear Solvers: Emphasis on avoiding direct matrix inversion. Recommended techniques include QR decomposition, LU decomposition, and SVD. The Eigen library is suggested as a good resource.
Non-linear Solvers:Gauss-Newton: An iterative method for solving non-linear least squares problems. Uses the Jacobian to approximate the Hessian.
Levenberg-Marquardt: A damped Gauss-Newton method that interpolates between Gauss-Newton and gradient descent, improving stability. Uses a damping factor to control the trust region and it "is typically the way to go like this is already um yeah this is like lemberg mark what is like when somebody talks about solvers and they say i use lm lm stands for lamborgh this is well known".
BFGS/L-BFGS: Quasi-Newton methods that approximate the Hessian with rank-one updates, efficient for large problems. With L-BFGS using "limited memory" so that it "is the way to go actually in practice everybody uses lpfgs".
Robust Norms & Regularization: Techniques to handle outliers. Robust norms (e.g., L1 norm) are less sensitive to outliers than L2. Regularization terms penalize complex solutions, encouraging smoother or simpler results.
Derivatives: Approximated numerically using central differences. Dual numbers, implemented using C++ templates, offer a more accurate and efficient way to compute derivatives through auto-differentiation.
4. Rigid and Non-Rigid Reconstruction

Iterative Closest Point (ICP): An algorithm for aligning 3D scans. Variations include point-to-point and point-to-plane ICP. "But then instead of trying to minimize the distance between these two points you now compute the point here and based on this point you optimized you get the normal and then you're optimizing the projection on this plane that is given by the normal here."
Volumetric Integration: Fusing multiple depth maps into a single SDF representation. This involves projecting voxels into each depth map and averaging the SDF values.
As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) Deformation: A technique for non-rigid deformation that aims to preserve local rigidity. It involves assigning a rigid transformation to each vertex and minimizing the deviation from these rigid transformations. ""and that's why it's called as rooted as possible right". In a discrete setting, the edge lengths are considered using "cotangent weights" which is a "very common thing what people do". The problem can be solved by "flip-flop" where the vertices are fixed, and the rotations solved, or the rotations fixed and vertices solved.
5. Feature Detection

FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) Keypoint Detector: This simple detector looks for points where a circle of pixels around the central point has a sufficient number of contiguous pixels that are either all brighter or all darker than the central pixel's intensity.
Harris Corner Detector: Detects corners by looking at the local gradients. “Harris is doing it via this the shift function basically um and you're looking how the intensity changes locally." The Harris Corner Detector is based on shift in function and checking the Eigenvalues.
6. Research Paper: PoseNet and Deep Learning for Pose Estimation (Kendall et al.)

The research paper introduces PoseNet, a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for camera pose regression. It is capable of estimating 6DOF (degrees of freedom) camera pose from a single RGB image.

XXV. Iterative Closest Point (ICP) Algorithm Details
•
Core Idea: ICP iteratively refines the alignment between two point clouds by finding correspondences and minimising the distance between them.
•
Basic ICP Steps:
◦
Select random points in the source frame.
◦
Match each point to the closest point in the target frame, often using a KD-tree for efficient nearest neighbour search.
◦
Reject outliers based on distance or surface normal differences.
◦
Solve for the rotation and translation that minimises the error function.
◦
Iterate by finding new correspondences.
•
Importance of Initial Alignment: ICP requires a reasonable initial alignment to converge.
•
ICP Variations and Considerations: Speed, stability, tolerance to noise and outliers, and maximum initial misalignment are key considerations.
•
Protective Correspondences: In RGB-D data, projecting points from one frame to another can quickly establish correspondences.
•
Point-to-Plane ICP: Minimising the distance from a point to the tangent plane of its corresponding point often yields better results than point-to-point distance minimisation.
•
Minimisation Techniques:
◦
Linearisation: Approximating the error function and solving the resulting linear system.
◦
Levenberg-Marquardt: Using a non-linear least squares solver like Levenberg-Marquardt can provide quadratic convergence.
•
Course-to-Fine Approach: Starting with lower resolution data can improve convergence speed and avoid local minima.
XXVI. Implicit Surface Reconstruction with Signed Distance Fields (SDFs)
•
Signed Distance Fields (SDF): Represent a surface implicitly by storing the distance to the surface at each point in a grid, with the sign indicating inside or outside.
•
Truncated Signed Distance Fields (TSDF): Limit the distance values to a truncation value to improve efficiency and accuracy.
•
Volumetric Fusion: Combines multiple depth maps into a TSDF.
•
Raycasting: Project rays through each pixel and traverse the TSDF grid to find surface intersections.
•
Marching Cubes: Extract a mesh from the TSDF grid.
•
Real-time Reconstruction: Achieved by combining ICP and volumetric fusion. KinectFusion is a prominent example.
•
Model Update: New depth data is integrated into the TSDF based on the estimated camera pose.
•
Addressing Memory Constraints: Techniques like extended KinectFusion, hierarchical KinectFusion, and voxel hashing are used to manage memory usage and enable larger-scale reconstructions. Voxel hashing is a volumetric spatial hashing method.
XXVII. Non-Rigid Reconstruction
•
Challenges: Handling dynamic scenes where objects deform over time.
•
Deformation Proxy: A lower-resolution representation used to deform the mesh.
•
Cage-Based Deformations: Uses control nodes (a cage) and barycentric coordinates to deform the mesh.
•
Non-Rigid ICP: Extends ICP to handle non-rigid deformations by jointly solving for correspondences and deformations.
•
Non-Rigid Tracking: Aligning a template mesh to a deforming object over time.
•
Energy Functions: Combines data terms (e.g., point-to-point, point-to-plane, colour alignment) and regularisation terms (e.g., ARAP).
XXVIII. Optimization for 3D Reconstruction
•
Handling Outliers: Essential for accurate reconstruction. Techniques include RANSAC, robust norms, and iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS).
•
Solvers: Levenberg-Marquardt is a popular choice. Others include BFGS and LBFGS.
•
Automatic Differentiation: Using dual numbers and libraries like Ceres can simplify the computation of derivatives.
XXIX. Feature Extraction and Matching
•
Feature Descriptors: Should be scaling, view, and lighting invariant.

This detailed expansion integrates information from multiple sources to provide a more complete overview of the concepts and techniques involved in 3D scanning, motion capture, and reconstruction.



XXXI. In-Depth Look at ICP and its Variations
•
ICP Algorithm Refinement through Iteration: ICP's iterative nature is central to its function. The algorithm repeatedly improves the alignment between point clouds by alternating between finding closest point correspondences and computing a transformation that minimizes the distance between these correspondences.
•
Nearest Neighbour Search: Efficiently finding the closest points between datasets is crucial. KD-trees and libraries like ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbors) and Nanoflann are useful tools for fast nearest neighbour lookups.
•
Outlier Rejection: Distance thresholds and surface normal comparisons are common methods for removing incorrect correspondences that can negatively impact alignment.
•
Point-to-Plane vs. Point-to-Point ICP: Using the point-to-plane distance, where the distance from a point in one cloud to the tangent plane of its correspondence in the other is minimised, often leads to better results than direct point-to-point distance minimisation. This is because it allows for sliding along the plane.
•
Linearization and the Use of SVD: One approach to minimising the error function involves linearising the problem and solving the resulting linear system. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a fundamental tool for solving these optimisation problems.
•
Levenberg-Marquardt Optimisation: A more robust approach is to use the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, a non-linear least squares solver that offers quadratic convergence.
XXXII. Advanced Implicit Surface Reconstruction Techniques
•
Truncated Signed Distance Functions (TSDFs): TSDFs are essential for efficiently integrating depth data from multiple views into a single volumetric representation. By truncating the signed distance values, memory usage is reduced and the influence of noisy or inaccurate depth measurements is limited.
•
Volumetric Fusion for Model Updating: New depth data is fused into the TSDF volume by projecting rays from the camera's viewpoint through each voxel in the grid. The TSDF values are then updated based on the observed depth values along these rays.
•
Real-time Performance with KinectFusion: The KinectFusion algorithm demonstrated that real-time 3D reconstruction is possible by combining ICP-based camera tracking with TSDF-based volumetric fusion.
•
Addressing Memory Limitations: Voxel hashing and hierarchical KinectFusion were developed to overcome the memory limitations of the original KinectFusion algorithm, enabling the reconstruction of larger scenes.
XXXIII. Handling Deformations and Non-Rigid Tracking
•
Cage-Based Deformation: Cage-based deformation is a technique that uses a control cage surrounding the object to drive deformations. By manipulating the control points of the cage, the underlying mesh can be deformed in a smooth and controllable manner.
•
Non-Rigid ICP: Non-rigid ICP extends the traditional ICP algorithm to handle deformations. It jointly optimises for the transformation and deformation parameters, allowing the algorithm to align deforming objects.
•
Energy Functions in Non-Rigid Tracking: Energy functions typically combine data terms (e.g., point-to-point distances, point-to-plane distances, colour alignment) with regularisation terms that encourage smoothness and prevent excessive deformation.
XXXIV. Optimization Considerations and Techniques
•
Outlier Removal is Critical: Outliers can significantly degrade the accuracy of 3D reconstruction algorithms. RANSAC, robust norms, and iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) are effective techniques for mitigating the impact of outliers.
•
Choice of Solvers: While Gauss-Newton and Levenberg-Marquardt are popular choices, other solvers like BFGS and LBFGS may be more appropriate for certain problems.
•
Automatic Differentiation Simplifies Development: Automatic differentiation, using dual numbers and libraries like Ceres, automates the computation of derivatives, simplifying the development and debugging of optimisation problems.
XXXV. Feature Extraction, Matching, and High-Level Scene Understanding
•
Feature Selection: The choice of feature descriptor depends on the specific application and the characteristics of the data. SIFT, SURF, and ORB are popular choices, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
•
Bundle Adjustment: Bundle adjustment globally refines both the camera poses and the 3D point positions by minimising the reprojection error.
XXXVI. Practical System Implementation
•
Multi-View Setups: Multi-view setups provide more constraints and reduce occlusions, leading to more robust and accurate tracking.
•
IMU Integration Enhances Tracking: Fusing data from inertial measurement units (IMUs) with visual tracking algorithms can significantly improve the robustness and accuracy of camera pose estimation, particularly in challenging environments.
•
Software and Libraries: There are tools and libraries available. For example, PointGrid is a public GitHub repository, but with no description or website provided.
By integrating these detailed points, a more nuanced comprehension of the practical and theoretical elements of 3D geometry, SLAM, and sensor fusion is achievable.
